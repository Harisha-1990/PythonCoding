#Formatted strings or f string
name = 'Johnny'
age = 55
print('hi '+name +' you are ' +str(age) +' years old') 
# f below indicates the formatted string instead of doing conversion and concatenation. This is a new feature of Python 3 by adding f to the beginning, lettijng python knows that it's a formatted string
print(f'hi {name} you are {age} years old') 

#In python we had a .format 
print('hi {} you are {} years old'.format(name,age))
print('hi {0} you are {1} years old'.format(name,age))
print('hi {0} you are {1} years old'.format(name,age))
print('hi {new_name} you are {age} years old'.format(new_name='sally',age=100))
