# Good practices to write variables
# snake_case
# start with lowercase or underscore
# letteres, numbers, underscores
# case sensitive
# don't overwrite keywords

# constants 
# cosntants are not going to change throughout the program.
# indicate constants in Upper case
# if we want we can change and reassign to different value
#but good practice is not to change constants
PI = 3.14

 #dunder varibales
 # they are with double underscores __
 # we should not create a regular variable with two underscores __ and assign a value to it
